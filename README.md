# Unity Nord
This is a Nordic theme for Unity.<br/>
In order to use it, you will first have to import [Unity Editor Themes](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/editor-themes-plugin-free-211041).<br/>
Navigate to the `Assets/EditorThemes/Editor/Themes/` directory and run one of the following commands:<br/>
`curl -O -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnra6864/UnityNord/master/UnityNord.json`<br/>
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnra6864/UnityNord/master/UnityNord.json`<br/>
If neither curl nor wget are installed, you can manually download the [theme file](https://github.com/nnra6864/UnityNord/blob/master/UnityNord.json) by opening [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnra6864/UnityNord/master/UnityNord.json) and pressing ctrl+s to save it.<br/>
Once you have the file downloaded in this directory, open up Unity, navigate to `Themes` in the menu bar, open up the `Select Themes` window and select the Nord theme.<br/>
